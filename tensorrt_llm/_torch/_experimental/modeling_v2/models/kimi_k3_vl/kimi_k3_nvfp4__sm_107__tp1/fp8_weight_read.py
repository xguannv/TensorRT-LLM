"""Kimi K3 NVFP4 on Rubin (SM107), tp1: projections that read FP8 block-scaled weights.

``_Fp8BlockScaleWeightReadLinear`` keeps a bias-free projection as E4M3 codes with 128x128
block scales: the checkpoint FP8 attention projections, and the MoE layers' BF16 MLPs when
they are quantized after loading. Low-M rows run the generic low-M GEMM; the rest runs DeepGEMM

``_convert_moe_mlps_to_fp8_weight_read`` put it in place of a loaded linear.
