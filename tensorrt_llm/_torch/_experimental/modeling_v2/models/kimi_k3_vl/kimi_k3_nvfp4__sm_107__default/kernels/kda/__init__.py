"""CuTe DSL kernels for Kimi K3 KDA prefill on Blackwell GPUs.

Private copy of the Rubin agentic branch's ``cute_dsl_kernels/blackwell/kimi_k3_kda`` (the
kernels its runtime ran): the prefill pipeline (``fused_k123``, ``akk_inverse``,
``k4_persistent``) and the multi-token verify kernels (``kda_mtp_decode``, ``kda_mtp_decode_v2``,
``kda_mtp_decode_2cta``). The files are verbatim; main's different KDA kernels under
``attention/kernels/blackwell/kimi_k3_kda`` are untouched. Nothing is imported here: the op
launchers ``ops/ssm/_kda_prefill.py`` and ``kernels/kda/mtp_ops.py`` import these on first use.
